// Write a program that will prompt the user for a number greater than 1. Your program will then count off all the numbers
// from 1 to their number and output each number as even or odd.
// â€¢ Sample Output: 1 is odd, 2 is even, 3 is odd, 4 is even, 5 is odd, and so on until the user entered number is entered.
