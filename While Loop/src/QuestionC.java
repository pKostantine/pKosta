// Prompt the user for a number greater than 1 which will serve as your ending number. Your program will then count from
// the number 1 to the entered ending number. If the number is a multiple of 3, then the program prints Donut instead of
// the number. If the number is a multiple of 5, then it prints out Cookie instead of the number. If the number is a multiple
// of both 3 and 5 it prints out Bagel. Otherwise, it prints out the actual number
// â€¢ Sample Output: 1, 2, Donut, 4, Cookie, Donut, 7, 8, Donut, Cookie, 11, Donut, 13, 14, Bagel, 16, 17, Donut, 19, Cookie, Donut, etc.
